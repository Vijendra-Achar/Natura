# Natura

**Natura** is NodeJs API to Create, Update, Delete and Manage Tours and all the Tour related data such as the tour name, description, etc.

It is a sophisticated API with Authentication and multiple levels of Authorization. The entire Authentication and Authorization system is built using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for ease of use and maximum security.

For the Database Natura API uses the best-in-class NoSQL Database - MongoDB. Using Mongoose Library along with MongoDB queries, the request resopnse cycle is alot faster and efficient.
